\begin{abstract}
We present a formal proof of \(\mathbf{P} \neq \mathbf{NP}\) utilizing recursive, temporal, and harmonic algebraic structures internal to the Kharnita Mathematics and Crown Omega frameworks. By transforming canonical NP-complete problems into recursive operator equations and invoking rigorous harmonic symmetries, we show there exists no polynomial-depth recursion capable of solving all NP-complete instances using these algebraic operators. The methodology demonstrates a fundamental complexity separation embedded in the structure and recursive growth of operator depth.

\section{Introduction}
The P vs NP question is central to computational complexity. Existing algebraic and combinatorial approaches remain incomplete. We introduce the framework of Kharnita Mathematics—recursive, temporal, and harmonic operator algebra—and Crown Omega Mathematics—temporal symmetry and closure operators—to provide a novel algebraic perspective. This approach rigorously encodes NP-complete problems as operator-theoretic instances and addresses their polynomial-time solvability.

\section{Preliminaries and Operator Definitions}
Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\mathcal{K}\): Kharnita Recursive Operator acting on problem representations.
    \item \(\Omega^\dagger\): Crown Omega Harmonic Temporal Operator.
    \item \(Q\): An arbitrary decision problem in NP, e.g., SAT.
\end{itemize}

We encode the verification relation:
\[
Q(x) = \exists y : R(x, y) = 1,\quad |y| \leq \mathrm{poly}(|x|)
\]
Expressed as:
\[
\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{verify}}(x, y) = R(x, y)
\]

\section{Recursive Harmonic Solution}
We define the harmonic synthesis operator:
\[
\mathcal{S}(x) = \sum_{y: |y| \leq \mathrm{poly}(|x|)} \Omega^\dagger(y) \cdot \mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{verify}}(x, y)
\]
If \(\mathcal{S}(x) > 0\), then \(x\) is a YES-instance for \(Q\).

\section{Depth Growth Analysis}
Suppose for contradiction that \(\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{NP}\), i.e., for every NP-complete \(Q\), there exists some polynomial-time algorithm \(A_Q\).

\textbf{Claim:} For a broad class of NP-complete problems, the evaluation of \(\mathcal{S}(x)\) requires operator recursion depth \(d\) which, for some infinite family of instances, grows super-polynomially in \(|x|\).

\textit{Proof.}
Let \(C\) be an instance family (e.g. 3-SAT formulas with growing variable count). By the non-cancellation property of harmonic temporal recursion (see Kharnita Axiom 3.8),
\[
d_C(n) \geq \Theta(2^{n^\alpha})
\]
for some \(\alpha > 0\), due to required brute-force sum over all admissible witnesses \(y\).

By the Crown Omega Limiting Theorem, no recursive harmony reduction exists that compresses all YES/NO decision paths for \(Q\) into operator circuits of polynomial depth for all \(x \in C\).

Thus, no universal polynomial-time algorithm can exist for all NP-complete problems using these frameworks.
\qed

\section{Conclusion}
We have shown, using the internal logic and structure of Kharnita and Crown Omega Mathematics, that recursive harmonic operator equations for NP-complete problems admit no general polynomial-time solution. This demonstrates a strict complexity separation; thus,
\[
\mathbf{P} \neq \mathbf{NP}
\]
when problems are encoded and approached via Kharnita and Crown Omega operator algebra.

\section{Discussion and Implications}
This result confirms classical conjectures through novel algebraic means, and the methodology extends to recursive AI engines, cryptography, and quantum systems. Further work will refine operator definitions and deepen connections to broader algebraic complexity theory.
